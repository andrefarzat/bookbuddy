use the one-line namespace without brackets pattern. Example: namespace BookBuddy.Domain.Cars;

When creating a Domain class, create it inside a folder with the same name as the main aggregate root class in the plural form (example: Car domain inside Cars folder). Add all classes at the root of that folder (i.e., Do not create subfolders).
